# Remove analytics button from tweets

This extension removes the first button of tweets, known as the 'analytics' button. It is a simple script that uses the `MutationObserver` API.

To use it, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericbsantana/remove-twitter-analytics-button.git
```

And [load it locally on your Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).

# UPDATE:

They finally fixed the order of analytics button on tweets!

I enjoyed learning on how to make an extension for Google Chrome :)
